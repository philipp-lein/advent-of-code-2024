# 🎄 Advent of Code 2024 🎅

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2024 repository! 🌟 This is where I will be tracking my progress and solutions for the daily coding challenges. 🧩✨

## 💻 Get ready for:

📆 Daily puzzles from December 1st to 25th

🧠 Brain-teasing problems to solve

🔢 Fun with numbers and algorithms

🌍 Exploring New Languages 🌟
This year, I’m also taking the opportunity to learn and explore new programming languages as part of the challenge! 🚀 Here’s what I plan to try out:

- 🦀 Rust: Systems programming with safety and performance.
- 💎 Ruby: Elegant syntax, great for web development.
- 🛠 Go: Lightweight and ideal for concurrent programming.
- 🔣 Haskell: Dive into functional programming.
- 💡 Elixir: Build scalable, distributed systems.

Happy Christmas

Stay tuned for updates! 🚀🎉
